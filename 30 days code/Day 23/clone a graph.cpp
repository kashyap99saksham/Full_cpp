/*
  Approach is to perform BFS and to maintain which node is visited and not we maintain a hash with key as original node and value as clone of that node
  While visiting the neighboring vertices of a node u get the corresponding cloned node for u , letâ€™s call that cloneNodeU , 
  now visit all the neighboring nodes for u and for each neighbor find the corresponding clone node(if not found create one) 
  and then push into the neighboring vector of cloneNodeU node.
  How to verify if the cloned graph is a correct?
  Do a BFS traversal before and after the cloning of graph. In BFS traversal display the value of a node along with its address/reference.
  Compare the order in which nodes are displayed, if the values are same but the address/reference is different for both the traversals than the cloned graph is correct.
  Below approach is only for single component undirected graph
