/*
  Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, 
  vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
  The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).
  
  In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, 
  we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. 
  Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
